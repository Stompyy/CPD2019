# Week one

I have made a good effort over the Christmas period to start on work that I know will be due soon. Optimisation and porting are quite self explanatory, and I reflect on time misspent on less important but more enjoyable modules from the term before (NES, after I had a good quality submission, vs everything else). By doing a lot of the work over Christmas I hope to spend a good amount of time on my dissertation without any distractions.

# Week two

There has begun a focus on getting ourselves job market ready for when this course finishes. I reflect on previous CPD reports promising to gain a good footing with local businesses, and that I have have not done this in a while. I get the feeling that this may not be an optimum approach to the job market and that I need to polish my online prescence as a priority.

# Week three

Following feedback from the group project in the first half of the project I try to take more of a lead role with some aspects of the group project game. Not wishing to step on anyone's toes, I start a new game mode within the game and take ownership of it. This will be my chief contribution to the project so I take some time to make sure it is set up and operates the way that I want.

# Week four

It has been some time since I spent any time with my dissertation. Perhaps dedicating so much effort on it over the Christmas period stunted my progress with it. My project has a slightly different approach to others where I start with my data set and use my artefact to process it, as opposed to the artefact being responsible for collecting the data set. I revisit the project by concentrating on my optimisation project which is linked to the processing method. This is promising although I begin to realise that I have a lot more to do!

# Week five

I'm not great at design. My website shows as much. I contemplate whether I should look into improving this and how? Instead I concentrate on features within it such as a MCTS AI connect4 game in JavaScript in the browser. I reflect that any recruiter who looks at the website will hopefully be more concerned with functionality rather than judging it completely by it's looks.

# Week six

Sadly, I have had to start taking a backseat from the group project due to all other deadline commitments. I did make effort to leave the project in a complete state with no backlog or unfinished jobs, and to make this known to all other teammates so that they know not to rely on me for critical jobs. I still make the effort to complete small jobs and bug fixes to stay part of the group, but reflect on the disproportionate work/credits ratio compared to other approaching deadlines. I feel proud that I had the foresight to see this coming, and warn the team while finishing my backlog, as opposed to previous years where this period has come as a shock to everyone involved.

# Week seven

My dissertation is not behaving. Well, it is not behaving how I want it to be. I am getting meaningful results in a different area though, so I contemplate either changing my hypotheses to fit these results, or to attempt to leverage the results into a fashion that supports my original hypotheses but in a lesser way. Meanwhile, feedback that I should amend my literature review has not started yet. It has been a long time since I have read any scientific papers and feel as if I have lost the momentum that research requires. I must try to amend this before it becomes too intimidating.

# Week eight

With the end of the course in sight, I have started to spend a lot of time job seeking. Both online and in person, leading to interviews and even a job offer. I reflect that I am getting distracted with this and am not spending the time that I should be on my dissertation. I force myself to stop applying for jobs until after my dissertation has been submitted.
